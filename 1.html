  <h2>Self-Studying How to code</h2>
    <p><u>July 6 (Wed) D+1 </u><br>
        I thought if I become an editor who works in other countries how I am. I imagined that would be cool.
        That's why I started to learn how to code. I learned about tag. There are more than 150 tags.
        I could know about 'strong' that what I write is emphasized by using. Also I learned 'u' this makes underline.
        I guess Coding is so interesting that I can study continuously. This makes me happy.
        I'll try to do my best because nobody knows that I can be an editor in other countries later. I trust and love myself.</p>

        I learned deepen tags that were 'br', 'p'.
        The former is to get new line and the latter is to distinguish between paragraphs.
        Also I learned 'h1'~'h6' those can adjust the size of what I wrote.
        I remind myself that I should use appropriate tags when I want to express something.
        I'm sure if I use properly it'll make more elaborate.
        I understood why HTML is important thing well. The most important thing is accessibility.
        It means everyone has accessiblilty without being disturbed. there are two grammars in Html.
        One of grammars is tag that I've learn, the other one is attribute.
        Now when a tag lacks information only by its, I should use in order to add information or meaning.
        I feel I'm getting better to code.</p>

      I got so many tags today. It's absolutely difficult to understand. First one is 'li' that I could make lists.
       when I code 'li' I must use 'ol' or 'ul' that these seem same to the relationship between parent and children.
      One of the tags is meta charset="utf-8" if I don't use this , Korean couldn't be shown on site.
      I ask computer to open html with UTF-8 by coding a meta tag, so I can solve it well without any problems.
      I could change title of webpage, distinguish between 'head' and 'body' and keep the pledge that I have to write 'html' when I code.
      There is idiomatic tag to inform that is html document. this is '!doctype' It's should be at the beginning of html.
      The most important tag that I learned today is 'a' that means anchor to link to the other site.
      I code 'a' tag with writing'href="Site's name"' if I click some words between 'a' code you can go to the other page that is linked.
      if I want to open the page with a new tab, I might use 'targe="_blank"'. Last one that I learned is 'title=html5 something'.
      When you place the cursor on the word that is linked to the other page, you can see a tool tip imformation what is linked before you click.</p>
